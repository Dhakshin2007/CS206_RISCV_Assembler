## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue (such as command injection, file exposure, or unsafe process execution):

1. **Do not open a public issue** — this protects everyone using the project.
2. Instead, send a private email to:  
   **`dhakshin.dev@gmail.com`**
3. Include:
   - A clear description of the issue  
   - Steps to reproduce (if possible)  
   - Suggested fixes or mitigations  

You’ll receive an acknowledgement within **5 working days**, and we’ll discuss the resolution privately before public disclosure.

## Security Practices

- All web code runs within a **non-privileged Node.js environment**.  
- The backend avoids direct file uploads and executes C++ binaries with limited I/O permissions.  
- Sensitive user data is **not collected** or stored.  
- The offline assembler runs locally — it should be executed only on trusted systems.
